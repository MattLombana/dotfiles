# Matt Lombana's Dotfiles Repo

This is a HIGHLY WIP project. As of now, it hosts my bashrc and vimrc, however I plan on adding my .tmux.conf as well as a few other miscellaneous files.

My plan for this repo is to only host my dotfiles. It currently has an Ansible directory as well as a makesimlinks.sh script, but my plan is to create a new repo (I'll probably call it "sysadmin" or something similar) which hosts all of my useful scripts, as well as the ansible playbooks I use to configure my different operating systems.
